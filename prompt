You are a senior software developer. All code has to run on an ESP32. Code for Visual Studio Code with Platform IO.
Your job is to code software that runs on an ESP32 - more precisely the “ESP32 Devkit 1” - that allows the “Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4k” to be controlled via Bluetooth.
Because the ESP32 board has no screen we need to make the interface available via a web interface that is hosted on the esp32 board (made available via wifi). The hotspot should be called BMPCC-node and the password should be “esp32p4k” The web interface should be able to display and change all the settings made available via BT by the camera. The focus of the camera should also be controllable with a potentiometer and the AS5600 encoder that is connected to the ESP32.
You find all the info about the protocol the camera uses in the “BMD-protocol-SDK.md” file in the repo.
Also add a README in markdown to the repo that contains a description of the functionality of the project and all the necessary instructions and steps to build, compile and flash the code onto the ESP32 as well on how to connect the potentiometer and the encoder.
If there are any uncertainties, unclear things or problems let me know them before you start with your job. Don’t start coding before you are 100% sure about all the details you need to know before start coding a flawless repo.

I understand you want to create a system for controlling a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K using an ESP32, with both Bluetooth control and a web interface, plus physical controls via a potentiometer and AS5600 encoder. Let me address some important points and potential concerns before proceeding:
You:
	1	Access to Protocol Documentation
	◦	I notice that while you mentioned the BMD-protocol-SDK.md file, it's listed as not being shown to me. I'll need access to this documentation to properly implement the Bluetooth communication protocol with the camera.
	2	Hardware Specifications Needed
	◦	Could you specify which GPIO pins should be used for:
	▪	The AS5600 encoder (requires I2C - SDA and SCL pins)
	▪	The potentiometer (requires an analog input pin)
	◦	Are there any specific voltage requirements or limitations for these components?
	3	Web Interface Requirements
	◦	Should the web interface be mobile-responsive?
	◦	Do you have any specific preferences for the UI layout or design?
	◦	Should settings changes be applied immediately or require confirmation?
	◦	Should there be any status indicators for the Bluetooth connection?
	4	Bluetooth Implementation
	◦	Does the camera need to be paired first, or does it accept connections directly?
	◦	Should the system automatically reconnect if the connection is lost?
	◦	Should there be a way to select between multiple cameras if more than one is in range?
	5	Focus Control Behavior
	◦	How should the focus control work exactly? For example:
	▪	Should the potentiometer/encoder provide absolute or relative focus control?
	▪	Should there be different sensitivity modes for fine vs coarse adjustment?
	▪	Should the current focus position be displayed in the web interface?
	6	Error Handling
	◦	How should the system handle various error conditions like:
	▪	Camera disconnection
	▪	WiFi connection issues
	▪	Sensor failures
	▪	Invalid settings values
	7	Development Environment
	◦	Are you specifically requiring PlatformIO for this project?
	◦	Should the project include both PlatformIO and Arduino IDE support?
Please provide clarification on these points so I can ensure the implementation meets your requirements exactly. Once these details are clarified, I can proceed with creating a comprehensive solution that includes:
	•	Full ESP32 firmware code
	•	Web interface implementation
	•	Hardware connection diagrams
	•	Detailed README with setup instructions
	•	Error handling and recovery procedures
	•	Complete build and deployment instructions
Would you please address these points so I can proceed with the implementation?

Me:

1	Access to Protocol Documentation
◦	Ihow can i send you the .md file? 
2	Hardware Specifications Needed
◦	choose pins that fit the specified board. otherwise use the following:
▪	Analog Pin: GPIO 36,
▪	SDA: GPIO 21, 
▪	SCL:GPIO 22
◦	there are no specific voltage requirements or limitations for these components
3	Web Interface Requirements
◦	the web interface should be mobile-responsive - actually it should be optimised for smartphone screens?
◦	specific preferences for the UI layout or design: follow the apple guidelines for mobile app design. Minimalistic but beautiful. Dark theme with bright font. red as special color.
◦	settings changes should be applied immediately?
◦	there should  be a status indicators for the Bluetooth connection
4	Bluetooth Implementation
◦	the camera needs to be paired first with a code of 6 digits
◦	the system  should  automatically reconnect if the connection is lost
◦	there should be a way to select between multiple cameras if more than one is in range - if possible to implement it should be even possible to connect multiple cameras at the same time and switch between them by selecting them on the web interface via menu->main overview. Also show battery indication there and if its recording or not via a small red filled circle if recording and a white one if not. also add the option to start recording all connected cameras simultaneously.
5	Focus Control Behavior
◦	How should the focus control work exactly? 
▪	use the highest available precision that the encoder and the poti provides on the esp32. Poti should be absolute. Encoder should be able absolute and relative depending on the setting in menu>settings>focus on the web interface
▪	there should be different sensitivity modes for fine vs coarse adjustment in menu>settings>focus on the web interface
▪	the current focus position should be displayed in the web interface and it should be possible to change it as well there. Each of the 3 input options (poti, encoder, web interface) should be able to control focus separately
6	Error Handling
◦	How should the system handle various error conditions like:
▪	Camera disconnection: display a small error message if it’s the connection to camera that isn’t selected currently and a normal error message if it’s selected currently
▪	WiFi connection issues: do nothing
▪	Sensor failures: do nothing
▪	Invalid settings values: display an error message that describes the problem
7	Development Environment
◦	Are you specifically requiring PlatformIO for this project: yes
◦	Should the project include both PlatformIO and Arduino IDE support: if possible yes but focus on PlatformIO
You:
Regarding the BMD-protocol-SDK.md file, there are a few ways you can share it with me:
	1	You can paste the contents directly in your next message
	2	You can share it in multiple messages if it's too long for a single message
	3	You can share relevant sections of the protocol documentation as we implement specific features
The protocol documentation is crucial as it will define:
	•	The Bluetooth communication format
	•	Available camera settings and their data types
	•	Command structure for focus control
	•	Pairing and authentication process
	•	Status and feedback messages
	•	Any limitations or restrictions we need to consider
Without this documentation, I cannot implement the Bluetooth communication correctly. Could you please share the protocol documentation in your next message?
All other requirements are clear and well-defined. Once I have access to the protocol documentation, I can proceed with implementing the complete solution.

Me:
can you see the file "BMD-protocol-SDK.txt" in ~/project/ ?
No, I cannot see the contents of the "BMD-protocol-SDK.txt" file. While you mentioned it's in the project directory, I don't have access to its contents. Without the protocol documentation, I cannot proceed with implementing the Bluetooth communication with the camera.
Could you please share the contents of the BMD-protocol-SDK.txt file? This is essential for implementing the correct communication protocol with the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K.

## Developer Information ## Camera Control REST API
If you are a software developer you can build custom applications or leverage ready to use
tools such as REST client or Postman to seamlessly control and interact with your compatible
Blackmagic camera using Camera Control REST API. This API enables you to perform a wide
range of operations, such as starting or stopping recordings, accessing disk information and
much more. Whether you’re developing a custom application tailored to your specific needs
or utilizing existing tools, this API empowers you to unlock the full potential of your Blackmagic
camera with ease. We look forward to seeing what you come up with!

NOTE It’s important to mention that controlling Blackmagic cameras via REST API
relies on the web manager being enabled on each compatible Blackmagic camera.
Enable the web media manager in the Blackmagic Camera Setup ‘network access’
settings for each camera you are controlling.
The following Blackmagic cameras are compatible with Camera Control REST API:
 Blackmagic Cinema Camera 6K
 Blackmagic URSA Broadcast G
 Blackmagic Micro Studio Camera 4K G

 Blackmagic Studio Camera 4K Plus
 Blackmagic Studio Camera 4K Pro
 Blackmagic Studio Camera 6K Pro

 Blackmagic Studio Camera 4K Plus G
 Blackmagic Studio Camera 4K Pro G
Sending API Commands
To send an API command to your camera from a third party application such as Postman,
add /control/api/v1/ to the end of the camera’s Web media manager` URL or IP address.
For example, https://Studio-Camera-6K-Pro.local/control/api/v1/
You can find the Web media manager URL and IP address information in Blackmagic
Camera Setup.

The Web media manager URL in Blackmagic Camera Setup
Downloading API’s from your Camera
You can download REST API YAML documentation from your camera by adding
/control/documentation.html to the end of the camera’s Web media manager URL or IP
address. For example, https://Studio-Camera-6K-Pro.local/control/documentation.html

NOTE It’s worth noting that changing the camera name in Blackmagic Camera Setup
will also change the camera’s Web media manager URL.

## Blackmagic SDI Camera Control Protocol
Version 1.6.2
If you are a software developer you can use the Blackmagic SDI to construct devices that integrate
with our products. Here at Blackmagic Design, our approach is to open up our protocols and we
eagerly look forward to seeing what you come up with!
Overview
This document describes an extensible protocol for sending a unidirectional stream of small control
messages embedded in the non-active picture region of a digital video stream. The video stream
containing the protocol stream may be broadcast to a number of devices. Device addressing is used
to allow the sender to specify which device each message is directed to.
Assumptions
Alignment and padding constraints are explicitly described in the protocol document. Bit fields are
packed from LSB first. Message groups, individual messages and command headers are defined as,
and can be assumed to be, 32 bit aligned.
Blanking Encoding
A message group is encoded into a SMPTE 291M packet with DID/SDID x51/x53 in the active region
of VANC line 16.
Message Grouping
Up to 32 messages may be concatenated and transmitted in one blanking packet up to a maximum
of 255 bytes payload. Under most circumstances, this should allow all messages to be sent with a
maximum of one frame latency.
If the transmitting device queues more bytes of message packets than can be sent in a single frame,
it should use heuristics to determine which packets to prioritize and send immediately. Lower priority
messages can be delayed to later frames, or dropped entirely as appropriate.
Abstract Message Packet Format
Every message packet consists of a three byte header followed by an optional variable length data
block. The maximum packet size is 64 bytes.
Destination device (uint8)

Device addresses are represented as an 8 bit unsigned integer. Individual
devices are numbered 0 through 254 with the value 255 reserved to
indicate a broadcast message to all devices.
Command length (uint8)

The command length is an 8 bit unsigned integer which specifies the
length of the included command data. The length does NOT include
the length of the header or any trailing padding bytes.
Command id (uint8)

The command id is an 8 bit unsigned integer which indicates the message
type being sent. Receiving devices should ignore any commands that they
do not understand. Commands 0 through 127 are reserved for commands
that apply to multiple types of devices. Commands 128 through 255 are
device specific.
Reserved (uint8)

This byte is reserved for alignment and expansion purposes. It should
be set to zero.
Command data (uint8[])

The command data may contain between 0 and 60 bytes of data.
The format of the data section is defined by the command itself.
Padding (uint8[])

Messages must be padded up to a 32 bit boundary with 0x0 bytes.
Any padding bytes are NOT included in the command length.
Receiving devices should use the destination device address and or the command identifier to
determine which messages to process. The receiver should use the command length to skip
irrelevant or unknown commands and should be careful to skip the implicit padding as well.
Defined Commands
Command 0 : change configuration

Category (uint8)

The category number specifies one of up to 256 configuration categories
available on the device.

Parameter (uint8)

The parameter number specifies one of 256 potential configuration
parameters available on the device. Parameters 0 through 127 are
device specific parameters. Parameters 128 though 255 are reserved
for parameters that apply to multiple types of devices.

Data type (uint8)

The data type specifies the type of the remaining data. The packet length
is used to determine the number of elements in the message. Each
message must contain an integral number of data elements.
Currently defined values are:

0: void/boolean

A void value is represented as a boolean array of length zero.

The data field is a 8 bit value with 0 meaning false and all other
values meaning true.

1: signed byte Data elements are signed bytes

2: signed 16 bit integer Data elements are signed 16 bit values

3: signed 32 bit integer Data elements are signed 32 bit values

4: signed 64 bit integer Data elements are signed 64 bit values

5: UTF-8 string Data elements represent a UTF-8 string with no terminating character.
Data types 6 through 127 are reserved.

128: signed 5.11 fixed
point

Data elements are signed 16 bit integers representing a real number with
5 bits for the integer component and 11 bits for the fractional component.
The fixed point representation is equal to the real value multiplied by 2^11.
The representable range is from -16.0 to 15.9995 (15 + 2047/2048).

Data types 129 through 255 are available for device specific purposes.

Operation type (uint8)

The operation type specifies what action to perform on the specified
parameter. Currently defined values are:

0: assign value

The supplied values are assigned to the specified parameter. Each
element will be clamped according to its valid range. A void parameter
may only be ‘assigned’ an empty list of boolean type. This operation will
trigger the action associated with that parameter. A boolean value may be
assigned the value zero for false, and any other value for true.

1: offset/toggle value

Each value specifies signed offsets of the same type to be added to the
current parameter values. The resulting parameter value will be clamped
according to their valid range. It is not valid to apply an offset to a void
value. Applying any offset other than zero to a boolean value will invert
that value.

Operation types 2 through 127 are reserved.

Operation types 128 through 255 are available for device specific purposes.

Data (void)

The data field is 0 or more bytes as determined by the data type and
number of elements.

The category, parameter, data type and operation type partition a 24 bit operation space.

## Blackmagic Embedded Tally Control Protocol
Version 1.0 (30/04/14)
This section is for third party developers or anybody who may wish to add support for the
Blackmagic Embedded Tally Control Protocol to their products or system. It describes the
protocol for sending tally information embedded in the non-active picture region of a digital
video stream.
Data Flow
A master device such as a broadcast switcher embeds tally information into its program feed
which is broadcast to a number of slave devices such as cameras or camera controllers. The
output from the slave devices is typically fed back to the master device, but may also be sent to
a video monitor.
The primary flow of tally information is from the master device to the slaves. Each slave device
may use its device id to extract and display the relevant tally information.
Slave devices pass through the tally packet on their output and update the monitor tally status,
so that monitor devices connected to that individual output may display tally status without
knowledge of the device id they are monitoring.
Assumptions
Any data alignment / padding is explicit in the protocol. Bit fields are packed from LSB first.
Blanking Encoding
One tally control packet may be sent per video frame. Packets are encoded as a SMPTE 291M
packet with DID/SDID x51/x52 in the active region of VANC line 15. A tally control packet may
contain up to 256 bytes of tally information.
Packet Format
Each tally status consists of 4 bits of information:
uint4
bit 0: program tally status (0=off, 1=on)
bit 1: preview tally status (0=off, 1=on)
bit 2-3: reserved (0x0)
The first byte of the tally packet contains the monitor device tally status and a version number.
Subsequent bytes of the tally packet contain tally status for pairs of slave devices. The
master device sends tally status for the number of devices configured/supported, up to a
maximum of 510.
struct tally
uint8
bit 0: monitor device program tally status (0=off, 1=on)

Request notifications for this characteristic to receive timecode updates.
Timecode (HH:MM:SS:mm) is represented by a 32-bit BCD number: (eg. 09:12:53:10 =
0x09125310)

Blackmagic Bluetooth Camera Control 46
Camera Status (encrypted)
UUID: 7FE8691D-95DC-4FC5-8ABD-CA74339B51B9
Request notifications for this characteristic to receive camera status updates.
The camera status is represented by flags contained in an 8-bit integer:
None = 0x00
Camera Power On = 0x01
Connected = 0x02
Paired = 0x04
Versions Verified = 0x08
Initial Payload Received = 0x10
Camera Ready = 0x20
Send a value of 0x00 to power a connected camera off.
Send a value of 0x01 to power a connected camera on.
Device Name
UUID: FFAC0C52-C9FB-41A0-B063-CC76282EB89C
Send a device name to the camera (max. 32 characters).
The camera will display this name in the Bluetooth Setup Menu.
Protocol Version
UUID: 8F1FD018-B508-456F-8F82-3D392BEE2706
Read this value to determine the camera’s supported CCU protocol version.

NOTE Encrypted characteristics can only be used once a device has successfully
bonded or paired with the Blackmagic Camera. Once a connection has been
established, any attempt to write to an encrypted characteristic will initiate bonding.
For example, writing a ‘Camera Power On’ (0x01) message to the Camera Status
characteristic.

Once bonding is initiated, the camera will display a 6-digit pin in the Bluetooth Setup
Menu. Enter this pin on your device to establish an encrypted connection. The device
will now be able to read, write and receive notifications from encrypted characteristics.

Blackmagic Bluetooth Camera Control 47


You:
Based on the provided protocol documentation, I can help you implement the Bluetooth control for the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K using an ESP32. Let me analyze the key requirements and identify any potential issues before we start coding.
Key Requirements Analysis:
	1	Bluetooth Communication:
	•	The camera uses Bluetooth LE
	•	Requires pairing with a 6-digit PIN code
	•	Uses encrypted characteristics for control
	•	Has specific UUIDs for different services and characteristics
	2	Web Interface:
	•	Mobile-responsive design optimized for smartphones
	•	Dark theme with bright font and red accent color
	•	Apple design guidelines
	•	Status indicators for Bluetooth connection
	•	Real-time settings updates
	•	Multiple camera support with battery/recording indicators
	3	Focus Control:
	•	AS5600 encoder and potentiometer support
	•	Both absolute and relative modes
	•	Multiple sensitivity modes
	•	Three input methods (encoder, potentiometer, web interface)
	4	Hardware Connections:
	•	Analog Pin: GPIO 36 (for potentiometer)
	•	SDA: GPIO 21 (for AS5600)
	•	SCL: GPIO 22 (for AS5600)
Potential Challenges/Questions:
	1	Bluetooth Security:
	•	The protocol requires encrypted characteristics after pairing
	•	Need to handle the pairing process and PIN code entry
	•	Need to maintain secure connection state
	2	Multiple Camera Support:
	•	Need to manage multiple simultaneous Bluetooth connections
	•	Need to handle switching between cameras
	•	Need to track status of each camera separately
	3	Focus Control:
	•	Need to handle different input methods simultaneously
	•	Need to implement different sensitivity modes
	•	Need to ensure smooth transitions between inputs
Before proceeding with implementation, I need to know:
	1	Do you have access to the actual camera to test the Bluetooth pairing process? This would be crucial for development and testing.
	2	What is the expected range of focus values from the camera? This would help in mapping the encoder and potentiometer values correctly.
	3	Should the web interface allow changing all camera settings available in the protocol, or just focus-related settings?
	4	How should the system handle connection loss? Should it attempt automatic reconnection?
	5	For multiple camera support, is there a maximum number of cameras that should be supported simultaneously?
Please provide clarification on these points so I can design the most appropriate solution.


Me:
1	yes
2	it should be in the markdown file i pasted previously? 24 bit and for focus it seems type: fixed16. i will paste the table below in a different format again
3	all camera settings
4	yes
5	8 cameras maximum
All clear now? if not don’t start coding.


You:
Based on the provided protocol documentation, I can now see all the details needed for implementing the Bluetooth camera control. Let me analyze the key aspects:
	1	Focus Control Protocol:
	•	Group: Lens
	•	ID: 0.0
	•	Type: fixed16
	•	Range: 0.0 (near) to 1.0 (far)
	•	Format: 16-bit fixed point number
	2	Bluetooth Protocol:
	•	Uses Bluetooth LE
	•	Requires 6-digit PIN pairing
	•	Has encrypted characteristics
	•	Service UUID: 291D567A-6D75-11E6-8B77-86F30CA893D3
	•	Camera Control UUID: 5DD3465F-1AEE-4299-8493-D2ECA2F8E1BB
	3	Hardware Connections:
	•	Potentiometer: GPIO 36 (ADC)
	•	AS5600 Encoder:
	◦	SDA: GPIO 21
	◦	SCL: GPIO 22
	4	Web Interface Requirements:
	•	Mobile-optimized
	•	Dark theme with bright font and red accent
	•	Apple design guidelines
	•	Status indicators for:
	◦	Bluetooth connection
	◦	Battery level
	◦	Recording status
	•	Support for up to 8 cameras
Before starting implementation, I have a few clarifying questions:
	1	For the AS5600 encoder, do you want to use the raw angle values (0-360°) or do you want to track multiple rotations? This affects how we map the encoder values to focus.
	2	For the potentiometer sensitivity modes in the web interface, what specific ranges would you like? For example:
	◦	Fine: 1/4 of full range
	◦	Medium: 1/2 of full range
	◦	Coarse: Full range
	3	For the web interface's focus control, should it use:
	◦	A slider
	◦	Direct numeric input
	◦	Both
	◦	Some other input method
	4	For multiple camera support, should the focus controls be:
	◦	Individual per camera
	◦	Synchronized across selected cameras
	◦	User selectable between individual/synchronized
Please provide clarification on these points so I can design the most appropriate solution.

Me:
	1	 adjustable settings in menu>settings>focus for 1) selectable amount of degrees between 30° and 360° in 1° steps. no multiple rotations
	2	adjustable in % from 20-100%
	3	input method: slider. value should show still. do the same for shutter, ISO, White Balance, Aperture, Tint, Framerate. Focus, shutter, White Balance each should also have an auto button on the right side next to it. Framrate and an off speed toggle on the right side
	4	User selectable between individual/synchronised
remember the website needs to run on the esp32. this project has to work without any internet connection or additional tools.
we need to serve the web interface directly from the ESP32 rather than having it as a separate React application. This changes our approach significantly.
For an ESP32-hosted solution, we should:
	1	Use a lightweight web interface that can be stored in ESP32's flash memory
	2	Implement a basic web server on the ESP32 to serve the interface
	3	Use WebSocket for real-time communication between the web interface and ESP32
	4	Store all files in SPIFFS (ESP32's file system)
Let’s create a new PlatformIO project that includes:
	•	ESP32 firmware with built-in web server
	•	Minimal, efficient web interface without heavy frameworks
	•	Direct WebSocket communication
	•	Local file storage
This approach will ensure:
	•	Everything runs locally on the ESP32
	•	No internet connection required
	•	No external dependencies
	•	Efficient resource usage
	•	Fast response times
